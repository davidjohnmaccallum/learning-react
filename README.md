# Learning React

Working thorough the [Intro to React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and thinking:

* I like React because HTML and CSS are familiar.
* I like Flutter because everything is a widget and the component tree is very obvious. For example, I can add state to the component tree.
* That said, React has a component tree. But the component tree seems less obvious in React.
* Calling setState() updates the component and all children.
* The other thing I like about Flutter is its simplicity. It uses one language (Dart) to accomplish everything.
* Modern web development, like React, uses JavaScript (which has several variants), HTML, CSS (several variants) and a bunch of different build tools. It's complex.
*  I love the React testing framework. Headless component tests like Flutter.

## Debugging

* Very easy to [get the VS Code debugger hooked up](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial#_debugging-react).
